Almost Generic multi-database migration configuration

DB MIGRATION STEPS:
1. Define SYSTEM_DB_URI in your env: this will determine which tables to migrate
    by default, any database in the client_accounts table will be migrated
2. Make sure that the "migrations" folder contains the modified version of env.py
3. DB migration needs to be initialized only once and is available as part of the application package under "migrations" folder
    Generally, running "python manage.py db init --multidb" is not required
4. Run "python manage.py db migrate"
5. Run "python manage.py db upgrade"

In the case of adding another client and a corresponding database (which does not contain the alembic_version table),
one can perform alembic_version table reset for all accounts by running:
    "python manage.py reset_alembic_version"
